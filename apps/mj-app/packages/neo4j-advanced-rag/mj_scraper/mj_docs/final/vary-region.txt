## How to Use Vary Region

### 4\. Select Areas to Regenerate

  * Choose the freehand or rectangular selection tools in the lower left of the Editor.

    * The size of your selection will affect your results. Larger selections give the Midjourney Bot more room to generate new creative details. Smaller selections will result in smaller, more subtle changes.

the undo button in the upper right corner.

image multiple times to experiment with different selections. Your previous
selection will be preserved. You can continue to add to this existing
selection or use the `undo` button to clear your selection.

The Midjourney Bot will process your Job and generate a new image grid of
variations within the area you selected.
