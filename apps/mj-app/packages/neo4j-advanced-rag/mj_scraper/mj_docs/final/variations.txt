Variations

# Variations

#### Use the `V1` `V2` `V3` `V4` buttons under each image grid, or use the
`Vary (Strong)` and `Vary (Subtle)` buttons under an upscaled image to
generate different versions of that image.

  * The `V` buttons correspond to the images in each generated grid from left to right, top to bottom, like this: ðŸ”¢.
  * Control your default amount of variation when using the `V` buttons with the `ðŸŽ¨ High Variation Mode` and `ðŸŽ¨ Low Variation Mode` in your settings. `ðŸŽ¨ High Variation Mode` is the default.
  * You can also use the `/prefer variability` command to toggle between High and Low Variation Modes.
  * Under upscaled images, the `ðŸª„ Vary (Strong)` button corresponds to `ðŸŽ¨ High Variation Mode`, while `ðŸª„ Vary (Subtle)` corresponds to `ðŸŽ¨ Low Variation Mode`. These buttons ignore your personal settings.

  

Want to change your prompt while you make variations? Enable `Remix Mode` in
your settings. Learn more about using Remix Mode and how it interacts with
your variation settings here.

## Variation Examples

When using Midjourney Version 5 or 6, or Niji Version 5 or 6, you can choose
between High and Low variation modes.

The default `ðŸŽ¨ High Variation Mode` will produce new images that vary from the
original image in composition, number of elements, colors, and types of
details. To use High Variation Mode, click a `V` button beneath a grid while
you have it selected in settings, or click the `ðŸª„ Vary (Strong)` button
beneath an upscaled image.

`ðŸŽ¨ Low Variation Mode` will produce new images that retain the composition and
colors of the original, but with subtle changes to the image details. To use
Low Variation Mode, select it in `/settings` and click the `V` button
corresponding to the iamge you want to vary, or click the `ðŸª„ Vary (Subtle)`
button beneath an upscaled image.

  

Prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `a cute robot holding flowers`

##### Original Upscaled Image

##### Image grid using `ðŸª„Vary (Strong)`

  

Prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `a bird watching a butterfly`

##### Original Upscaled Image

##### Image grid using `ðŸª„Vary (Subtle)`
