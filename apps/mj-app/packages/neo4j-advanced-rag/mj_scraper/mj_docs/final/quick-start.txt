### 4\. Go to any #General or #Newbie Channel

After joining the Midjourney server on Discord, you'll see several channels
listed in the sidebar.

### On the Midjourney Server

Locate and select any channel labeled `general-#` or `newbie-#`. These
channels are designed for beginners to start using the Midjourney Bot. The
Midjourney Bot will not generate images in other channels.

### On Other Servers

You can generate images with the Midjourney Bot on any Discord server that has
invited the Midjourney Bot. Look for instructions on your server on where to
use the Bot.

  

### 5\. Use the /imagine Command

**About Discord Commands**  
Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a Command. Commands are used
to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform
other helpful tasks. The `/imagine` command generates a unique image from a
short text description (known as a Prompt). Learn more about Prompts

  

**How to Use`/imagine`**

  * Type '/imagine prompt:' in the message field. You can also select the `/imagine` command from the list of available slash commands that pop up when you type '/'.
  * Type a description of the image you want to create in the `prompt` field.
  * Send your message. The Bot will interpret your text prompt and begin generating the images.
  * Respect the Community Guidelines. Community guidelines apply wherever the Midjourney Bot is used.

  

### 6\. Accept the Terms Of Service

Before generating any images, the Midjourney Bot will prompt you to accept the
Terms Of Service. You must agree to these terms to proceed with image
creation.

  

### 7\. Image Generation Process

After submitting a text prompt, the Midjourney Bot processes your request,
creating four unique image options within a minute. This process utilizes
advanced Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and each image generation counts
towards the GPU time included with your Midjourney subscription. To monitor
your available GPU time (Fast Time Remaining) use the `/info` command.

  

### 8\. Select an Image or Create Variations

Once your initial image grid has been generated, two rows of buttons become
available underneath your image grid.

`U1` `U2` `U3` `U4` Image Selection

In earlier versions of Midjourney, the `U` buttons were used for upscaling
images. With the latest model, images are immediately generated at 1024 x 1024
pixels size. Now, the 'U' buttons help you separate out your chosen image from
the grid, making it easier to download and giving you access to additional
editing and generation tools.

  

`üîÑ` Re-run or Re-roll a Job

The `üîÑ` button re-runs a Job. In this case, it would re-run the original
prompt producing a new grid of images.

  

`V1` `V2` `V3` `V4` Image Variation

The `V` buttons are used to create variations of the selected image. Each
button generates a new image grid that maintains the general style and
composition of the selected image.

  

### 9\. Enhance or Modify Your Image

After singling out an image, an expanded set of options becomes available.

`ü™Ñ Vary (Strong)` `ü™Ñ Vary (Subtle)`

Create a stronger or subtle variation of your selected image, generating a new
grid of four options.

`üîç Zoom Out 2x` `üîç Zoom Out 1.5x` `üîç Custom Zoom`

Zoom Out of your image, extending the canvas its original boundaries without
changing the content of the original image. The newly expanded canvas will be
filled-in using guidance from the prompt and the original image.

`‚¨ÖÔ∏è` `‚û°Ô∏è` `‚¨ÜÔ∏è` `‚¨áÔ∏è`

The Pan buttons allow you to expand the canvas of an image in a chosen
direction without changing the content of the original image. The newly
expanded canvas will be filled in using guidance from the prompt and the
original image.

`‚ù§Ô∏è Favorite`

## Billing and Subscription Queries

You can interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord by typing a Command.
Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user
info, and perform other helpful tasks.

Midjourney Commands can be used in any Bot Channel, on private Discord servers
where the Midjourney Bot has been permitted to operate, or in a direct message
with the Midjourney Bot.

A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce
an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt
into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data
and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique
and exciting images.
