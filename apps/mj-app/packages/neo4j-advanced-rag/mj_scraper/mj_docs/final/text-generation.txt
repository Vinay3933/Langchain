Text Generation

# Text Generation

#### With Midjourney Version 6, you can use double quotation marks (`"`)
around words or phrases in your prompts to specify text you want to appear in
your images.

  * When using Midjourney Version 6, you can use "quotation marks" to indicate parts of your prompt you want to appear in your image as text: `a cyberpunk cat with a neon sign that says "Midjourney"`.
  * Single quote marks/apostrophes won't work--Midjourney only recognizes "words and phrases in double quotations" as text that should appear in the resulting image.
  * Text generation is supported for standard Latin alphabet (English) characters. Shorter words and phrases are more likely to be generated accurately.
  * If you're having trouble generating the exact word or phrase in your prompt, try using `--style raw` or lower Stylize values, or try using Vary Region to correct small issues.
