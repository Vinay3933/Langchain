Fast, Relax, & Turbo Modes

# Fast, Relax, & Turbo Modes

#### Midjourney uses powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to interpret
and process each prompt. When you purchase a subscription to Midjourney, you
are purchasing time on these GPUs.

Different subscription plans have different amounts of monthly GPU time.  
This monthly subscription GPU time is **Fast Mode** time. Fast Mode tries to
give you access to a GPU instantly. It's the default processing tier and uses
your subscription's monthly GPU time.

### How many GPU minutes do my generations cost?

The Average Job the Midjourney bot processes takes about one minute of GPU
time to finish creating an image. Upscaling an image, using nonstandard aspect
ratios, or older Midjourney Model Versions may take more time. Creating
variations or using lower quality values will take less time.

A Job's time depends on the following factors:

| \+ Lower Time| ++ Average Time| +++ Higher Time  
---|---|---|---  
Job Type| Variations| `/imagine`| Upscale  
Aspect Ratio| default (square)| tall or wide|  
Quality Parameter| `--q 0.25` or `--q 0.5`| default (`--q 1`)| `--q 2` (for
legacy Model Versions)  
Stop Parameter| `--stop 10`‚Äì`--stop 99`| default (`--stop 100`)|  
  
  

Use `/info` before and after running a process to see how many of your
remaining GPU minutes the generation used.

## Fast vs. Relax Mode

Subscribers to the Standard, Pro, and Mega plans can create an unlimited
number of images each month in Relax Mode. Relax Mode will not cost any GPU
time, but Jobs will be placed into a queue based on how much you've used the
system.

### How long do I need to wait in Relax mode?

Jobs in Relax mode are placed in a queue to be processed as GPUs become
available. Wait times for Relax are dynamic but generally range between 0‚Äì10
minutes per job. If you use Relax mode occasionally, you will have shorter
wait times compared to subscribers that have used it more. This priority
currently resets whenever you renew your monthly subscription.

### Limitations

Permutation prompts, the \--repeat parameter and the Legacy upscaler, Max
Upscale are not available while useing Relax mode.

### Run Out of Fast Time?

You can purchase more Fast Hours on your Midjourney.com/accounts page.

By default, images are generated using Fast Mode.  
Unused monthly Fast GPU time does not roll over.  
Fast Mode is automatically reactivated when the subscription renews.

## Turbo Mode

Turbo Mode is available for subscribers who want extremely quick image
generation. Turbo mode uses a high-speed experimental GPU pool. Jobs run in
Turbo mode generate up to four times faster but consume twice as many
subscription GPU minutes as a typical Fast Mode Job.

Turbo mode is only available with Midjourney Model Versions 5, 5.1, 5.2, and
6.

If Turbo mode is selected, but the GPUs are unavailable, or it is incompatible
with the selected model version, your job will run in Fast Mode instead.

Turbo Mode is an experimental feature, and availability and price may change
at any time.

## How to Switch Between Modes

All users have access to Fast and Turbo Modes. Only Standard, Pro, and Mega
Plan subscribers can use Relax Mode.

Your website and Discord settings are separate. This includes your preference
of Relax, Fast, or Turbo Mode. Double-check your Discord and website settings
before generating any images to be sure they're set to the mode you want to
use.

### In Discord

#### Using Commands

Use `/relax`, `/fast`, or `/turbo` as a standalone command in Discord to
switch between image generation speeds.

Switching this way will apply your choice to all your future prompts until you
use a different command to change modes, choose a different mode in your
settings, or use a different mode parameter in your prompt.

  

#### Using Settings

Use the `/settings` command and choose `üê¢ Relax` `üêá Fast` or `‚ö° Turbo` from
the menu.

  

#### Using the `--relax` `--fast` or `--turbo` parameters

To override your default generation speed for a specific prompt, you can add
the `--fast`, `--relax`, or `--turbo` parameter at the end.

### Website Settings

You can choose between Stealth and Public modes as your default "Speed" with
buttons in the website Settings menu:

  

Your current default Speed will be highlighted in red.

The Speed you set here will apply to all your prompts unless you specify a
different one using the `--relax` or `--fast` or `--turbo` parameter in an
individual prompt.

A **Job** is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. **Jobs** include using
`/imagine` to create an initial image grid, upscaling images, and creating
variations of images.
