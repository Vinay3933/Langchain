`--repeat` with other parameters, like \--chaos to increase the pace of your
visual exploration.

`--repeat` accepts values 2–40 for Pro and Mega subscribers  
The `--repeat` parameter can only be used in Fast and Turbo GPU mode.

### Use the `--repeat` or `--r` Parameter

Add `--repeat <value>` or `--r <value>` to the end of your prompt.

A **Job** is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. **Jobs** include using
`/imagine` to create an initial image grid, upscaling images, and creating
variations of images.

There are two modes for image generation, **Fast Mode** and**Relax Mode**.
Fast Mode tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's the highest-priority
processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time. **Relax Mode**
queues your generation behind others based on how much you've used the system.
**Relax Mode** wait times are variable and usually range from 1–10 minutes.

By default, your images will be generated using **Fast** mode. You can switch
to **Relax** if you have a Standard or Pro subscription.Midjourney is an independent research lab exploring new mediums of thought and
expanding the imaginative powers of the human species. We are a small self-
funded team focused on design, human infrastructure, and AI.
