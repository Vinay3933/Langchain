Thank you for your feedback

#### The Pan option allows you to expand the canvas of an image in a chosen
direction without changing the content of the original image. The newly
expanded canvas will be filled in using guidance from the prompt and the
original image.

Pan allows you to increase the image resolution beyond the maximum 1024px x
1024px dimensions in one direction.  
Pan is compatible with Midjourney Model Version 5, 5.1, 5.2, and niji 5

## Panning an Image

The Pan buttons `⬅️` `➡️` `⬆️` `⬇️` will appear after upscaling an image. When
panning, only the closest 512 pixels to the side of the image, along with the
prompt, are used to determine the new section.

  

`Prompt: A vibrant fantasy landscape`

##### Starting Image

##### Pan `⬆️`

##### Pan `⬇️`

##### Pan `⬅️`

##### Pan `➡️`

After panning an image once, you can only pan that image again in the same
direction (horizontal/vertical). You may continue to pan in that direction as
often as you like. After panning several times, the image may become too large
to send on Discord. When this happens, you will be sent a link to the image
instead.

Pan `⬅️` and `➡️` several times

panning.

##### Starting Image

Starting prompt: `A vibrant fantasy landscape`

##### Pan `➡️` \+ `Remixed Prompt`

Pan `➡️` \+ ` Remix prompt: A vibrant fantasy city`
