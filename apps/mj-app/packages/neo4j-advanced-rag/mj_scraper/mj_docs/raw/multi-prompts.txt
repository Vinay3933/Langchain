#### The Midjourney Bot can blend multiple concepts using :: as a separator.
Using a multi-prompt allows you to assign relative importance to the concept
in the prompt, helping you control how they are blended together.

## Multi-Prompt Basics

Adding a double colon `::` to a prompt indicates to the Midjourney Bot that it
should consider each part of the prompt individually. For the prompt `space
ship` both words are considered together, and the Midjourney Bot produces
images of sci-fi spaceships. If the prompt is separated into two parts,
`space:: ship`, both concepts are considered separately, then blended together
creating a sailing ship traveling through space.  
  

There is no space between the double colons `::`  
Multi-prompts work with Model Versions `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `'5`, `niji`, and
`niji 5`  
Any parameters are still added to the very end of the prompt.

  

### `space ship`

 _space ship_ is considered as a single thought.

### `space:: ship`

 _space_ and _ship_ are considered separate thoughts

`cheese cake painting`

 _cheese cake painting_ is considered together, producing a painted image of a
cheesecake.

`cheese:: cake painting`

 _cheese_ is considered separately from _cake painting_ , producing images of
painted cakes made of cheeses.

`cheese:: cake:: painting`

 _cheese_ , _cake_ , and _painting_ are considered separately, producing
tiered cakes, made of cheeses with common classical painting compositions and
elements.

## Prompt Weights

When a double colon `::` is used to separate a prompt into different parts,
you can add a number immediately after the double colon to assign the relative
importance to that part of the prompt.

In the example below, the prompt `space:: ship` produced a sailing ship
traveling through space. Changing the prompt to `space::2 ship` makes the word
**space** twice as important as the word ship, producing images of space that
have ships as a supporting element.

[Model Versions] `1`, `2`, `3` only accept whole numbers as weights  
[Model Versions] `4`, `niji 4`, `niji 5`, `5`, `5.1`, and `5.2` and can accept
decimal places for weights  
Non-specified weights default to 1.

### `space:: ship`

 _space_ and _ship_ are considered as separate thoughts

### `space::2 ship`

 _space_ is twice as important as _ship_

**Weights are normalized:**  
`space:: ship` is the same as `space::1 ship`, `space:: ship::1`,`space::2
ship::2`, `space::100 ship::100`, etc.  
`cheese::2 cake` is the same as `cheese::4 cake::2`, `cheese::100 cake::50`
etc.  
`cheese:: cake:: painting` is the same as `cheese::1 cake::1 painting::1`,
`cheese::1 cake:: painting::`, `cheese::2 cake::2 painting::2` etc.

### Negative Prompt Weights

Negative weights can be added to parts of a multi-prompt to help remove
unwanted elements.  
The sum of all weights must be a positive number.

`still life gouache painting`

a range of objects appear in the still life

`still life gouache painting:: fruit::-.5`

The still life has fewer fruits

  

### The `--no` Parameter

The `--no` parameter is the same as weighing part of a multi prompt to "-.5"
`vibrant tulip fields:: red::-.5` is the same as `vibrant tulip fields --no
red`.
