Thank you for your feedback

#### The Zoom Out option allows you to extend the canvas of an upscaled image
beyond its original boundaries without changing the content of the original
image. The newly expanded canvas will be filled-in using guidance from the
prompt and the original image.

`Zoom Out` does not increase the maximum 1024px x 1024 px size of an image.

## Make Square

With `Make Square` you can adjust the aspect ratio of a non-square image to
make it square. If the original aspect ratio is wide (landscape), it will be
expanded vertically. If it is tall (portrait), it will be expanded
horizontally. The emoji `↔️` `↕️` next to the `↔️ Make Square` button also
indicates which way the image will be expanded. The `↔️ Make Square` button
will appear underneath non-square upscaled images.

  

Prompt: vibrant California poppies

## Custom Zoom

The `🔎 Custom Zoom` button lets you choose how much to zoom out on an image.
`🔎 Custom Zoom` button under an upscaled image will pop up a dialogue box
where you enter a custom value for `--zoom`. `--zoom` accepts values between
1-2.

Change the Aspect Ratio of an Upscaled Image

You can use `--zoom 1` in this `Custom Zoom` pop-up box to change the aspect
ratio, with the `--ar parameter`, without zooming out.

  

### Change Your Prompt with Custom Zoom

`🔎 Custom Zoom` allows you to change the prompt before you expand your image,
giving you finer control over the finished image. For example, changing the
prompt to "A framed picture on the wall" gives this result:

##### `Starting Image`

prompt: vibrant California poppies

##### `Custom Zoom + Changed Prompt`

`Zoom Out` prompt: A framed picture on the wall --zoom 2
