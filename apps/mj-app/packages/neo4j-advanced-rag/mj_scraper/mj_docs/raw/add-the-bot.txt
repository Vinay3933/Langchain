## Bot Management

### Restrict the Bot to Specific Channels

If you do not want the Midjourney Bot to be usable in specific channels, go to
**Edit Channel** , select the **Permissions** tab, select **@everyone** under
**Roles/Members** and **_Uncheck_ "Use Application Commands."** Users who try
to use the Midjourney Bot in a channel with these permissions disabled will
not see the command.

For more granular control, go to **Settings** , select **Integrations** , the
**Permissions** tab, the **\+ for the Midjourney Bot** , and **Manage
Integration.** `slash command` permissions can then be set for individual
roles and channels.

  

### Get Status Updates and Announcements on Your Server

Follow the Midjourney Official Discord #announcements, #community updates, and
#status channels on your server to stay up-to-date with Midjourney.
