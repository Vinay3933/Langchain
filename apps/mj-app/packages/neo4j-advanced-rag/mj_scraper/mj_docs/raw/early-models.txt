Thank you for your feedback

#### Midjourney regularly introduces new model versions to improve coherency,
efficiency, quality, and style. You can switch model versions by using the
/settings command and selecting your preferred model version. Different models
excel at producing different types of images.

## Model Version 1, 2, and 3 (Legacy)

You can access earlier midjourney models by using the `--version` or `--v`
parameter or by using the `/settings` command and selecting a model version.
Different models excel at different types of images.

prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `vibrant California poppies --v 1`

##### `--version 3`

default model: 07/22–11/22

 _highly creative compositions_

 _moderate coherency_

##### `--version 2`

default model: 04/22–07/22

 _creative, colorful, and painterly_

 _low coherency_

##### `--version 1`

default model: 02/22–04/22

 _very abstract and painterly_

 _low coherency_

##### `--hd` (high definition)

early alternative model

 _busy detailed and abstract_

 _low coherency_

## Niji Model 4 (Legacy)

The `niji 4` model is a collaboration between Midjourney and Spellbrush tuned
to produce anime and illustrative styles. The `--niji 4` model has vastly more
knowledge of anime, anime styles, and anime aesthetics. It's excellent at
dynamic and action shots and character-focused compositions in general.

prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `vibrant California poppies --niji 4`

##### `--v 4`

California poppies --v 4

##### `--niji 4`

California poppies --niji 4

##### `--v 4`

birds sitting on a twig --v 4

##### `--niji 4`

birds sitting on a twig --niji 4

## Test Models (Legacy)

Occasionally new models are released temporarily for community testing and
feedback. There are currently two available test models: `--test` and
`--testp`, which can be combined with the `--creative` parameter for more
varied compositions.

prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `vibrant California poppies --testp
--creative`

##### `--test`

 _A general-purpose artistic model with good coherency_

##### `--test` \+ `--creative`

##### `--testp`

 _A photo-realism model with good coherency_

##### `--testp` \+ `--creative`

Notes on current test models `--test` and `--testp`

Test models only support `--stylize` values between 1250–5000.  
Test models do not support multi-prompts or image-prompts  
Test models have a maximum aspect ratio of 3:2 or 2:3.  
Test models only generate two initial grid images when the aspect ratio is
1:1.  
Test models only generate one initial grid image when the aspect ratio is not
1:1.  
Words near the front of the prompt may matter more than words near the back.

## Early Model Upscaler Tools

Earlier Midjourney model versions start by generating a grid of low-resolution
image options for each Job. You can use a Midjourney upscaler on any of these
images to increase the size and add additional details. There are multiple
upscale models available for upscaling an image. Using an upscaler uses your
subscription's GPU minutes.

The `U1` `U2` `U3` `U4` buttons under each image grid are used to upscale the
selected image.

### Midjourney Dimensions and Sizes

 _All sizes are for square 1:1 aspect ratios._

Model Version| Starting Grid Size| V4 Default Upscaler| Detail Upscale| Light
Upscale| Beta Upscale| Max Upscale**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
v1–v3| 256 x 256| -| 1024 x 1024*| 1024 x 1024| 1024 x 1024| 1664 x 1664  
niji| 512 x 512| 1024 x 1024| 1024 x 1024| 1024 x 1024| 2048 x 2048| -  
test / testp| 512 x 512| -| -| -| 2048 x 2048| -  
hd| 512 x 512| -| 1536 x 1536*| 1536 x 1536| 2048 x 2048| -  
  
`*` = the default upscaler for each Midjourney Version Model.  
`**` Max Upscale is an older resource-intensive upscaler and is only available
when users are in Fast Mode.

  

### Light Upscaler

The Light Upscaler creates a 1024px x 1024px image and adds a moderate amount
of details and textures. The Light Upscaler is useful for faces and smooth
surfaces when using older Midjourney Model Versions.

Use the `--uplight` parameter to change the behavior of the `U1` `U2` `U3`
`U4` upscale buttons to use the Light Upscaler.

##### prompt: `adorable rubber duck medieval knight`

##### prompt: `sand cathedral`

  

### Detailed Upscaler

The Detail Upscaler creates a 1024px x 1024px image and adds many additional
fine details to the image.

Images that have been upscaled with the detailed upscaler can be upscaled
again using the `Upscale to Max` button for a final resolution of 1664px x
1664px. `Upscale to Max` is only available when in Fast mode.

The Detailed upscaler was the default for Midjourney Model Versions `V1`,
`V2`, `V3`, and `hd`

##### prompt: `adorable rubber duck medieval knight`

##### prompt: `sand cathedral`

  

### Beta Upscaler

The Beta Upscaler creates a 2048px x 2048px image without adding many
additional details. The Beta Uspcaler is useful for faces and smooth surfaces.

Use the `--upbeta` parameter to change the behavior of the `U1` `U2` `U3` `U4`
upscale buttons to use the Beta Upscaler.

##### prompt: `adorable rubber duck medieval knight`

##### prompt: `sand cathedral`

The Midjourney Bot processes jobs on high-end GPUs. Each minute that it takes
to complete a job is a **GPU minute**. You have a limited amount of GPU
minutes when in **Fast Mode**. Because image generations may be processed on
multiple GPUs simultaneously, GPU minutes are not directly connected to the
time you wait for an image to generate.

There are two modes for image generation, **Fast Mode** and**Relax Mode**.
Fast Mode tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's the highest-priority
processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time. **Relax Mode**
queues your generation behind others based on how much you've used the system.
**Relax Mode** wait times are variable and usually range from 1–10 minutes.

By default, your images will be generated using **Fast** mode. You can switch
to **Relax** if you have a Standard or Pro subscription.
