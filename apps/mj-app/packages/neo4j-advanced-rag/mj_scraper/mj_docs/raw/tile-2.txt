#### The `--tile` parameter generates images that can be used as repeating
tiles to create seamless patterns for fabrics, wallpapers and textures.

`--tile` works with Model Versions `1` `2` `3` `test` `testp` `5` `5.1` `5.2`
and `6`.  
`--tile` only generates a single tile. Use a pattern making tool like this
Seamless Pattern Checker  to see the tile repeat.
