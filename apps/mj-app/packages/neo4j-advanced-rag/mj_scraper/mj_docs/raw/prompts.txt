#### A prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to
produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a
prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that are compared to its training
data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make
unique and exciting images.

## Basic Prompts

A basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji üòä.

  

Prompting Tip!

The Midjourney Bot works best with simple, short phrases that describe what
you want to see. Avoid long lists of requests and instructions. Instead of:
**Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright,
vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils**
Try: **Bright orange California poppies drawn with colored pencils**

## Advanced Prompts

More advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text
phrases, and one or more parameters

`Image Prompts`

Image URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the
finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt.

`Text Prompt`

The text description of what image you want to generate. See below for
prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing
images.

`Parameters`

Parameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios,
models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt.

## Prompting Notes

### Word Choice

Word choice matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances.
Instead of big, try tiny, huge, gigantic, enormous, or immense.

### Plural words and Collective Nouns

Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more
specific than "cats." Collective nouns also work, ‚Äúflock of birds‚Äù instead of
"birds.‚Äù

### Focus on What You Want

It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don‚Äôt want. If you
ask for a party with ‚Äúno cake,‚Äù your image will probably include a cake. To
ensure an object is not in the final image, try advanced prompting using the
`--no` parameter.

### Prompt Length and Details

Prompts can be simple. A single word or emoji will work. However, short
prompts rely on Midjourney‚Äôs default style, allowing it to fill in any
unspecified details creatively. Include any element that is important to you
in your prompt. Fewer details means more variety but less control.

**Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you.
Think about:**

  * **Subject:** _person, animal, character, location, object_
  * **Medium:** _photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry_
  * **Environment:** _indoors, outdoors, on the moon, underwater, in the city_
  * **Lighting:** _soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights_
  * **Color:** _vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel_
  * **Mood:** _sedate, calm, raucous, energetic_
  * **Composition:** _portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view_
