#### Combine Remix Mode and the Midjourney Vary Region editor to select and
regenerate specific parts of an upscaled image using a new or modified prompt.

  * The `Vary (Region)` button appears after a Midjourney image has been upscaled.
  * Regional variations results are guided by the content in your original image, the area you select, and the modified prompt used.
  * `Vary (Region)` is compatible with Midjourney Model Versions `V5`, `V6`, `niji 5`, and `niji 6`.

## How to Use Remix Mode with Vary (Region)

### 1\. Enable Remix Mode

Use the `/settings` command and select `üéõÔ∏è Remix` from the pop-up.

### 2\. Generate an Image

Create an image using the `/imagine` command.

  

### 3\. Upscale the Image

Use the U buttons to upscale your selected image.

  

### 4\. Select Vary Region

Click the `üñåÔ∏è Vary (Region)` button to open the editing interface.

  

### 5\. Select Areas to Regenerate

  * Choose the freehand or rectangular selection tools in the lower left of the Editor.
  * Select the areas of your image that you want to regenerate.
    * The size of your selection will affect your results. Larger selections give the Midjourney Bot more room to generate new creative details. Smaller selections will result in smaller, more subtle changes.  
Note: You cannot edit an existing selection but can undo multiple steps using
the undo button in the upper right corner.

  

### 6\. Modify Your Prompt

Describe what you want to generate in the selected areas with an updated
prompt. Your revised prompt should focus on the details you want to introduce
or change.

  

### 7\. Submit Your Job

Click the `Submit ‚Üí` button to send your request to Midjourney Bot. The Vary
Region editor can now be closed, and you can return to Discord while your Job
is processed.

**Note** You can use the Editor Button underneath an upscaled image multiple
times to experiment with different selections and prompts.

  

### 8\. View Your Results

The Midjourney Bot will process your Job and generate a new image grid using
the information from your original image and the guidance of your new prompt.

## Vary Region + Remix Prompting Tips

  * **Selections** The size of your selection affects the outcome. Larger selections provide the Midjourney Bot with more contextual information, which can improve the scaling and context of new additions. But selecting too much may lead to the newly generated elements blending or replacing parts of the original image you wished to preserve.

  * **Prompts** Experiment with how you modify your prompt when Using Vary Region + Remix Mode. Prompts should focus on what you want to happen in the selected area. The Midjourney Bot also considers the existing image when generating a selected area, so shorter focused prompts often are more effective. Midjourney Prompts should not be conversational. Instead of "Please change the meadow trail into a beautiful stream," be direct and prompt "meadow stream."

  * **Work in Small Steps** If you want to change many parts of an image, work on one part at a time. This way, you can create a focused prompt for each part.
