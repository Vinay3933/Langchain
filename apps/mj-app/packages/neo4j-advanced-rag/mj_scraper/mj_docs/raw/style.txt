#### The `--style` parameter replaces the default aesthetic of some Midjourney
Model Versions.

Model Versions 6, 5.2, 5.1 and Niji 6 accept `--style raw`.

## The Effects of `--style raw`

`--style raw` uses an alternative model that may work well for users already
comfortable with prompting who want more control over their images. Images
made with `--style raw` have less automatic beautification applied, which can
result in a more accurate match when prompting for specific styles.

## How to Use Styles

### Use the `--style` Parameter

Add `--style <style name>` to the end of your prompt on Discord or in the
imagine bar on the website:

  

### Use the Settings Command

Type `/settings` and select `ðŸ”§ RAW Mode` from the menu to append `--style raw`
to all prompts.

### Website Settings

You can choose between Standard and Raw styles as your default "Mode" with
buttons in the website Settings menu:

  

Your current default style will be highlighted in red.

If `Standard Mode` is your default style, you can override it by adding
`--style raw` to individual prompts. If `Raw Mode` is your default, you'll
need to switch back to `Standard Mode` in your setings to turn it off.
