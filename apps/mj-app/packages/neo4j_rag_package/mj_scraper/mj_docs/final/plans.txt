## Manage Your Plan

### Automatic Renewal

  * Unused monthly Fast GPU time does not roll over.
  * Your payment method on file with our third party payment processor will be automatically charged at the end of each monthly or annual billing period.

  

### Switch Plans

Upgrade your plan at any time. When upgrading, you may choose whether the
upgrade should be effective immediately or at the end of the current billing
cycle. If you choose to upgrade immediately, you will be offered a prorated
price based on the usage of the plan you are upgrading from. Downgrades are
always effective at the end of the current billing cycle.

  

Proration?

Unused Fast GPU Time is credited towards your account when you choose to
upgrade immediately. If a Basic subscriber upgrades immediately without using
any GPU time, they receive a $10 credit towards their new plan. If a Standard
subscriber upgrades after using 50% of their Fast GPU time, they receive a $15
credit towards their new plan.

  

### Cancellation

Go to https://www.midjourney.com/account/ to cancel a subscription at any
time. Cancellations are effective at the end of the current billing cycle.
Subscription benefits like access to the community gallery and the bulk
download tool are available until the end of the current billing cycle.

  

Your generated images and Midjourney.com/account page are not deleted if you
cancel your subscription. You can resubscribe to a plan at any time by
visiting https://www.midjourney.com/account/.

  

  

### Refunds

Refunds are available for subscribers who have lifetime usage of less than 20
GPU minutes, including time used in Relax Mode. If you are eligible for a
refund, the dialog box will automatically pop up when you click to cancel your
