Discord Emoji Reactions

# Discord Emoji Reactions

#### React with different emojis to Midjourney jobs to send images to your
Direct Messages, cancel a job in progress, or delete an image.

**React** to a generation with an emoji to trigger actions from the Midjourney
Bot.

## ❌ Cancel and Delete

❌ Cancels or deletes a job at any time. Reacting to a job with an X emoji also
removes the job from the Midjourney website. If you want to delete an image
from the Midjourney webpage but can't find the image within Discord, use the
`/show` command  to revive the job. The ❌ reaction only works with your own
jobs.

  

## ✉️ Send to Direct Messages

React with the envelope emoji ✉️ to send a completed job to direct messages.
The direct message will include the image's seed number and Job ID. If the
envelope emoji is used for an image grid the grid will be sent as individual
images. The ✉️ reaction only works with your own Jobs.

  

If you can't react to a job, it may be ephemeral. You'll see an `Only you can
see this` warning at the bottom of the job, and reactions won't work. Use the
`/show` command  to revive the job to react to it.

Job IDs are unique identifiers used for each image generated by Midjourney.  
Job IDs look like this: 9333dcd0-681e-4840-a29c-801e502ae424and can be found
in the first part of all image filenames, in the URLs on the website, and in
an image's filename.
