Character Reference

# Character Reference

#### You can use images as character references in your prompt to create
images of the same character in different situations.

To add character references to a prompt, use the --cref parameter with the web
address (URL) where the image is stored online: `--cref URL`

  

  * Character references work best when using images generated by Midjourney that feature a single character.
  * `--cref` is **not** designed to be used with photographs of real people, and will distort them.
  * Precise details like specific freckles or t-shirt logos aren't likely to be copied.
  * `--cref` can be used with Midjourney and Niji Version 6, and can be combined with `--sref`.
  * You can use multiple character references in a single prompt, but probably don't need to.
  * Any regular image prompts must go before `--cref`.

  

Privacy Notes

  * Upload images in your direct messages with the Midjourney Bot to prevent other server users from seeing an image.
  * Image prompts and references are visible on the Midjourney website unless you're generating in Stealth Mode.

  

### See the Image Prompts page for help using image URLs in your prompts on
Discord, or the Using Image References on Web page for help using all kinds of
image references on midjourney.com.

## Character Weight Parameter

Use the character weight parameter `--cw` to set the strength of
characterization. `--cw` accepts values from 0 to 100. `--cw 0` focuses on the
character's face only. Higher values use the character's face, hair, and
clothing. `--cw 100` is default.

prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `illustration of a man sitting in a cafe
--cref https://url.com/BlueHairGuy.png`

##### `--cw 0`

##### `--cw 50`

##### `--cw 100`

## Combining Style and Character References

To maintain a consistent style while using a character reference, you can
combine the `--sref` and `--cref` parameters. See the Style Reference page for
more information on using --sref.
