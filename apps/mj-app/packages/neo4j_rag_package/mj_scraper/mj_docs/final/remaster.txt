## Remaster

The Remaster feature is available for upscaled images generated using earlier
Midjourney Model Versions. It creates a new grid of images using the latest
Midjourney Model, combining the original image's composition with the
coherency of the newer Midjourney Model Version v5.2.

Remaster any previously upscaled job by clicking the `ðŸ†• Remaster` button
beneath the original upscale.

To Remaster very old jobs, use the `/show` command to refresh that job in
Discord.

  

prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `Byzantine sandcastle cathedral --v 2`
