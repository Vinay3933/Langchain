Model Version 5

# Model Version 5

#### Midjourney regularly introduces new model versions to improve coherency,
efficiency, quality, and style. You can switch model versions by using the
/settings command and selecting your preferred model version. Different models
excel at producing different types of images.

## Model Version 5.2 (Legacy)

The Midjourney V5.2 model was released in June 2023. To use this model, add
the `--v 5.2` parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the `/settings` command
and select `5Ô∏è‚É£ MJ Version 5.2`

Default Model 06/22/23‚Äì02/14/2024

This model produces more detailed, sharper results with better colors,
contrast, and compositions. It also has a slightly better understanding of
prompts than earlier models and is more responsive to the full range of the
`--stylize` parameter.

  

Prompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5.2

Prompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5.2

  

### Model Version 5.2 + Style Raw Parameter

Midjourney Model Versions 5.1 and 5.2 can be fine-tuned with the `--style raw`
parameter to reduce the Midjourney default aesthetic.

Read more about the Midjourney `--style` parameter.

  

##### `default --v 5.2`

`vibrant California poppies`

##### `--v 5.2 --style raw`

`vibrant California poppies --style raw`

##### `default --v 5.2`

`high contrast surreal collage`

##### `--v 5.2 --style raw`

`high contrast surreal collage --style raw`

## Model Version 5.1 (Legacy)

The Midjourney V5.1 was released on May 4th, 2023. To use this model, add the
`--v 5.1` parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the `/settings` command and
select `5Ô∏è‚É£ MJ Version 5.1`

Default Model 05/03/23‚Äì06/22/23

This model has a stronger default aesthetic than earlier versions, making it
easier to use with simple text prompts. It also has high Coherency, excels at
accurately interpreting natural language prompts, produces fewer unwanted
artifacts and borders, has increased image sharpness, and supports advanced
features like repeating patterns with `--tile`.

  

Prompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5.1

Prompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5.1

## Model Version 5.0 (Legacy)

The Midjourney V5.0 model produces more photographic generations than the V5.1
model. This model produces images that closely match the prompt but may
require longer prompts to achieve your desired aesthetic.

Default Model 03/30/23‚Äì05/03/23

To use this model, add the `--v 5` parameter to the end of a prompt, or use
the `/settings` command and select `5Ô∏è‚É£ MJ Version 5`  
  

Prompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5

Prompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5

## Niji Model 5 (Legacy)

The Niji model is a collaboration between Midjourney and Spellbrush tuned to
produce anime and illustrative styles with vastly more knowledge of anime,
anime styles, and anime aesthetics. It's excellent at dynamic and action shots
and character-focused compositions.

To use this model, add the `--niji 5` parameter to the end of a prompt, or use
the `/settings` command and select `üçè Niji version 5`

This model is sensitive to the `--stylize` parameter. Experiment with
different stylization ranges to fine-tune your images.

### Niji 5 Styles

Niji Model Version 5 can also be fine-tuned with `--style` parameters to
achieve unique looks. Try `--style cute`, `--style scenic`, `--style original`
(uses the original Niji Model Version 5, which was the default before May
26th, 2023), or `--style expressive`.

**Niji Style Parameters**  
`--style cute` creates charming and adorable characters, props, and settings.  
`--style expressive` has a more sophisticated illustrated feeling.  
`--style original` uses the original Niji Model Version 5, which was the
default before May 26th, 2023.  
`--style scenic` makes beautiful backgrounds and cinematic character moments
in the context of their fantastical surroundings.

##### `default --niji 5`

birds perching on a twig --niji 5

##### `--style original`

birds perching on a twig --niji 5 --style original

##### `--style cute`

birds perching on a twig --niji 5 --style cute

##### `--style expressive`

birds perching on a twig --niji 5 --style expressive

##### `--style scenic`

birds perching on a twig --niji 5 --style scenic

## V5 Upscaler Tools

Midjourney Model Version 5.2 produces grids of 1024 x 1024 pixel images. Use
the `U1` `U2` `U3` `U4` buttons under each image grid to separate your
selected image from its grid. You can then use the `Upscale (2x)` or `Upscale
(4x)` tools to increase the size of your image.

`Upscale` tools use your subscription's GPU minutes. Using `Upscale 2X` on an
image takes roughly twice as long as generating an initial image grid. Using
`Upscale 4X` on an image takes roughly six times as long as generating an
initial image grid.

V5 `Upscale` tools are not compatible with the pan tool or the tile parameter.

## Influence of \--stylize on Model Version 5

### Midjourney Model Version 5 Stylize Comparison

prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `child's drawing of a cat --s 100`

##### `--stylize 50`

Equal to `üñåÔ∏è Style Low`

##### `--stylize 100` (default)

Equal to `üñåÔ∏è Style Med`

##### `--stylize 250`

Equal to `üñåÔ∏è Style High`

##### `--stylize 750`

Equal to `üñåÔ∏è Style Very High`

**Coherency** is the strength of the connection between the text prompt and
the resulting image. A high degree of coherency means that the image will be
an accurate representation of the prompt text.

The Midjourney Bot processes jobs on high-end GPUs. Each minute that it takes
to complete a job is a **GPU minute**. You have a limited amount of GPU
minutes when in **Fast Mode**. Because image generations may be processed on
multiple GPUs simultaneously, GPU minutes are not directly connected to the
time you wait for an image to generate.
