Thank you for your feedback

#### The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise,
like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image
grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified
with the `--seed` parameter. If you use the same seed number and prompt, you
will get similar final images.

  * `--seed` accepts whole numbers 0–4294967295.
  * `--seed` values only influence the initial image grid.
  * Identical `--seed` values using Model Versions `1`, `2`, `3`, `test`, and `testp` will produce images with similar composition, color, and details.
  * Identical `--seed` values using Model Versions `4`, `5`, `6` and `niji` will produce nearly identical images.
  * Seed numbers are not static and should not be relied upon between sessions.

## Seed Parameter

If no Seed is specified, Midjourney will use a randomly generated seed number,
producing a wide variety of options each time a prompt is used.  
  

### Jobs run three times with random seeds:

prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `celadon owl pitcher`

  

### Jobs run three times with `--seed 12345`:

prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `celadon owl pitcher --seed 123`

## How to Find a Job's Seed Number

### Use a Discord Emoji Reaction

Find the seed number of a Job in discord by reacting with an ✉️ envelope emoji
to a Job.

  

### Use The Show Command to Bring Back Old Jobs

To get the seed number for a past image, copy the job ID  and use the `/show
<Job ID #>` command with that ID to revive the Job. You can then react to the
newly regenerated Job with an ✉️ envelope emoji.

## How To Change Seed Numbers

### Use the `--seed` Parameter

Add `--seed <value>` to the end of your prompt.

A **Job** is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. **Jobs** include using
`/imagine` to create an initial image grid, upscaling images, and creating
variations of images.
