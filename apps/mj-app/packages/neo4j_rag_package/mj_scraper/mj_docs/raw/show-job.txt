#### You can use the `/show` command with the unique Job ID to move a job to
another server or channel, revive a lost job, or refresh an old job to make
new variations, upscale, or use newer parameters and features.

`/show` only works on your own jobs.

## Find a Job ID

Job IDs are unique identifiers used for each image generated by Midjourney.  
Job IDs look like this: `9333dcd0-681e-4840-a29c-801e502ae424` and can be
found in the first part of all image filenames, in the URLs on the website,
and in an image's filename.

### On the Web

You can find the Job ID of any image in your member gallery by selecting
`Options` > `Copy` > `Job ID`.

  

### From the URL

Job IDs are in the URL when viewing an image in your Midjourney gallery.  
**https://www.midjourney.com/jobs/
9333dcd0-681e-4840-a29c-801e502ae424?index=0**.

  

### From the File Name

Job IDs are the last part of the file name when viewing an image you have
downloaded from your gallery.  
**User_cat_cloud_spirit_ 9333dcd0-681e-4840-a29c-801e502ae424.png**

  

### Using a Discord Emoji Reaction

React to your completed job with the envelope emoji ✉️ and Midjourney Bot will
send you a direct message with its Job ID. If you're not getting direct
messages from the bot, check your Discord privacy settings.
