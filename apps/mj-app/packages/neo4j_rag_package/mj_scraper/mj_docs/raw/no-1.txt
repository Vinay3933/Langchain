Thank you for your feedback

#### The No parameter tells the Midjourney Bot what not to include in your
image.

`--no` accepts multiple words separated with commas: `--no item1, item2,
item3, item4`

  

### `--No` Comparison

`still life gouache painting`

a range of objects appear in the still life

`still life gouache painting --no fruit`

The still life has fewer fruits

  

### `--no` vs. Don't

The Midjourney Bot considers every word in the prompt as a potential element
for the image. Prompting `still life gouache painting without any fruit` or
`still life gouache painting, please dont add fruit!` are _more_ likely to
produce pictures that include fruits because the relationship between
"without" or "don't" and the "fruit" is not interpreted by the Midjourney Bot
in the same way a human reader would understand it. To improve your results,
focus your prompt on what you do want to see in the image and use the "--no"
parameter to specify concepts you don't want to include.

`still life gouache painting`

A range of objects appear in the still life.

`still life gouache painting, please don't add fruit!`

_More_ fruit is present in the final image.

  

## Multi Prompting

The `--no` parameter is the same as weighing part of a multi prompt to "-.5"
`still life gouache painting:: fruit::-.5` is the same as `still life gouache
painting --no fruit`.
