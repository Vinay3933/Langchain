#### The `--quality` or `--q` parameter changes how much time is spent
generating an image. Higher-quality settings take longer to process and
produce more details. Higher values also mean more GPU minutes are used per
job. The quality setting does not impact resolution.

The default `--quality` value is 1.  
`--quality` only accepts the values: .25, .5, and 1 for the current model.
**Larger values are rounded down to 1.**  
`--quality` only influences the initial image generation.

## The Influence of Quality on Jobs

Higher `--quality` settings aren't always better. Sometimes a lower
`--quality` settings can produce better results—depending on the image you're
trying to create. Lower `--quality` settings might be best for a gestural
abstract look. Higher `--quality` values may improve the look of architectural
images that benefit from many details. Choose the setting that best matches
the image you're hoping to create.
