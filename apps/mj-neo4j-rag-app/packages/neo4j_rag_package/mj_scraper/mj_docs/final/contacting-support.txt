## Tech Support and General Questions

We provide support directly within Discord if you have an issue with the
Midjourney Bot or Midjourney.com website. You can find help in the `#support`
channel, just above the newbies rooms. Volunteers and helpful community
members run this channel and can't assist with billing issues.
