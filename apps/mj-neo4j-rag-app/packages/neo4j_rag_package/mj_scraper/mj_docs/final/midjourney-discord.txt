## Image Grids

The `/imagine` command produces a grid of low-resolution image options based
on your prompt. Use the buttons under each image grid to create variations of
an image, upscale an image, or rerun the last Midjourney Bot action.

### Upscale Buttons

`U1` `U2` `U3` `U4` buttons separate an image from the image grid, allowing
you easily download that image or use additional tools like Zoom Out, or Pan.

When using legacy Midjourney model versions the U buttons would upscale an
image generating a larger version of the selected image and adding more
details, which uses Fast GPU time.

### Redo

` üîÑ` The redo (re-roll) button reruns a job. In this case, it would rerun the
original prompt producing a new grid of images.

### Variation Buttons

`V1` `V2` `V3` `V4` V buttons create incremental variations of the selected
grid image. Creating a variation generates a new image grid similar to the
chosen image's overall style and composition.
