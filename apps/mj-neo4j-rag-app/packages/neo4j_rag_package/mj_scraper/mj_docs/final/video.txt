# Video

#### Use the `--video` parameter to create a short movie of your initial image
grid being generated. React to the finished job with the envelope ✉️ emoji to
have the Midjourney Bot send a link to the video to your Direct Messages.

`--video` only works on image grids, not upscales.  
`--video` works with Model Versions `5.2` `6` `niji 5` and `niji 6`.  
`--video` works with Legacy Model Versions `1` `2` `3` `5.0` `5.1` `test` and
`testp`.  
Generated videos are deleted 30 days after creation.
