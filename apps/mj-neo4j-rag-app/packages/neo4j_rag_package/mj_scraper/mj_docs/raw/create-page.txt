#### Generate Midjourney images directly on midjourney.com from the Create
page.

Creating images on the website is currently only available for users with at
least 100 Discord generations. To check your eligibility, use the `/info`
command wherever you generate images in Discord and look for your "Lifetime
Usage" count.

## Creating and Searching Images

Use the text fields at the top of the screen to enter prompts or search your
previous creations.

### 1\. Imagine Bar

Type your prompts here. Hit `Enter` to begin generating when you're ready. You
can use parameters in your prompts the same way you would in Discord, or you
can set them with the settings tool.

### 2\.  Image Prompts and References

Click the  button to open the image selection tool, where you can quickly and
easily manage image prompts, character references, and style references. For
more information about this tool, as well as about managing your uploaded
images, visit the Using Image References on Web page.

### 3\.  Settings

Click the settings button to access your personal settings. Preferences you
set here will automatically apply to all your prompts. If you want to use
different settings for a single prompt, you can use \--parameters in your
prompt to override your settings.

For example if your default Speed is Relax, you can run a single job in Fast
Mode by adding the `--fast` parameter to the end of your prompt.

Website settings are separate from Discord settings. This includes your
generation speed (Relax, Fast, or Turbo Mode) and Stealth Mode settings. In
particular, the website defaults to Public Mode images unless you turn Stealth
Mode on. Double-check your website settings before generating any images to be
sure your preferences are set correctly.  
Stealth Mode is only available on the Pro and Mega Plans.

**Website settings correspond to these features:**

Setting Name| Feature  
---|---  
Image Size| Aspect Ratio  
Stylization| Stylize  
Weirdness| Weird  
Variety| Chaos  
Mode| Style  
Version| Version  
Speed| Relax, Fast, or Turbo Mode  
Stealth| Stealth Mode  
  
### 4\.  Search

Search images in your Create feed. You can search by prompt text or
parameters.

## Hovering over an Image or Prompt

As you generate images, they'll appear on your Create page with the most
recent images at the top. Hovering over the generated images, or the prompt
display on the right, will show some additional options.

### Hovering over an Image

Hover over a generated image to reveal `Vary Subtle` and `Vary Strong`
buttons. Learn more about the differences between subtle and strong variations
on the Variations page.

### Hovering over a Prompt

On the right side of the Create page, you'll see the prompts used to generate
your images, including any parameters and image references. Hover over this
section to see additional actions you can take with your images:

**Rerun:** Repeat this job.

**Use:** Copy this prompt to the imagine bar to quickly reuse or tweak it.
Parameters and reference images used in the prompt will be copied too.

**Hide:** Hide this image from your Create feed. This will also hide the image
from your Archive. It will still be visible to other users unless it's also
Unpublished.

**More:** See a menu of additional options for this job:

Copy: Copy the prompt, job ID, seed, image, or image URL to your clipboard.  
Report: Report an image you believe violates the Community Guidelines.  
Publish /  Unpublish: Publish or Unpublish the image. This option only appears
if your plan includes Stealth Mode.  
Download: Download the selected image.  
Open in Discord: Jump to the location in Discord where this image was
generated. For images generated on the website, a `Discord URL not available`
error will appear if you click this button.

## Clicking on an Image

Click on an image in your Create page feed to see additional actions you can
take with that image.

### 1\. Job Type

For non-imagine jobs, hover over this label to see a preview of the original
set of images, with the parent image highlighted. Click on any image in the
preview to jump to that image.

### 2\. Menu Buttons

**Options**  
Manually copy prompt details, including the image URL and prompt, to use in
your own generations.

**Download**  
Download the selected image.

**Search**  
Search for other images like this one.

**Like**  
Like / ❤️ images so they appear in your "Liked" view.

### 3\. Create Feed

Click through to other nearby images from your Create feed. You can also use
your mouse wheel to scroll through these images from anywhere on the page.

### 4\. Image Actions

Use the buttons here to generate new images based on this one. Any actions not
shown aren't available for that image (for example, Vary Region will not be
available on upscaled images).  
To learn more about each of these actions, visit their feature pages: Vary,
Upscale, Remix, Pan, Zoom, Vary Region.  
The `Use` buttons allow you to quickly add elements of this job's prompt to
the imagine bar so you can reuse or tweak it. `Image` will add this image to
your next job as an image prompt. `Style` will add the image as a Style
Reference. `Prompt` will add the full prompt text, including parameters.

You can "Hide" images on the Midjourney website to remove them from your
Archive. They'll no longer be visible to you unless you have the "Hidden"
filter selected, but other users will still be able to view them (unless the
image is also "Unpublished"). Hiding images is a good way to keep your Archive
uncluttered.

You can "Unhide" your hidden images to restore them to your archive anytime,
so they're never lost.

By default, all images generated by Midjourney are "published," or viewable by
other users on midjourney.com. Users on plans that include Stealth Mode can
generate "unpublished" images that aren't visible to other users.

You can publish your own unpublished images at any time on the website. If you
have an active subscription that includes Stealth Mode, you can also unpublish
any published images you have.
