Thank you for your feedback

#### You can use images as part of a prompt to influence a Job's composition,
style, and colors. Images prompts can be used alone or with text
prompts—experiment with combining images with different styles for the most
exciting results.

To add images to a prompt, type or paste the web address where the image is
stored online. The address must end in an extension like .png, .gif, or .jpg.
After adding image addresses, add any additional text and parameters to
complete the prompt.

  

Prompts must have multiple image prompts or a single image prompt and a text
prompt to work.  
An image URL must be a direct link to an online image.  
Your file should end in .png, .gif, .webp, .jpg, or .jpeg.  
In most browsers, right-click or long-press an image and select Copy Image
Address to get the URL.  
The `/blend` command is a simplified image prompting process optimized for
mobile users.

  

Privacy Notes

  * Upload images in your direct messages with the Midjourney Bot to prevent other server users from seeing an image.
  * Image prompts and references are visible on the Midjourney website unless you're generating in Stealth Mode.

## How to Use an Image in Your Prompt

### 1\. Upload an image to Discord

Follow these instructions to upload your image to Discord.

  

### 2\. Copy your image's URL

*Discord Desktop App: Right-click on the image and select **Copy Link** (NOT "Copy Message Link").

  * Discord Web App: Click to expand the image, then right-click and choose "Copy image address."
  * Discord Mobile App: Tap and hold on the image, then select "Copy Media Link."

If none of these methods work, you can click to expand the image, and at the
bottom, select "Open in Browser" so you can copy and paste the image's URL.

To incorporate an image into your prompt, you need a direct image link that
ends with .png, .gif, .webp, .jpg, or .jpeg. If the image is on your computer
or phone, you can send it as a message to the Midjourney Bot first to generate
a link.

### How To Upload Your Image

## Add an Image URL to Your Prompt

To add an image to a prompt, begin typing `/imagine` as usual. After the
prompt box appears, drag the image file into the prompt box to add the image's
URL, or right-click and paste the link within the prompt box.

Aspect Ratio Tip

Crop images to the same aspect ratio as your final image for the best results.

## Image Weight Parameter

Use the image weight parameter `--iw` to adjust the importance of the image
vs. text portion of a prompt. The default value is used when no `--iw` is
specified. Higher `--iw` values mean the image prompt will have more impact on
the finished job.

See the Multi Prompts page for more information about the relative importance
between parts of a prompt.

Different Midjourney Version Models have different image weight ranges.

| Version 6| Version 5| Version 4| niji 6| niji 5  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Image Weight Default| 1| 1| NA| 1| 1  
Image Weight Range| 0–3| 0–2| NA| 0–3| 0–2  
  
  

prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `flowers.jpg birthday cake --iw .5`
